### future plan
* literature review, the state-of-art vision perception and sim2real research, eg. following up ICRA 2023
* redo the pipeline, may alter the scene and modify the reward function; and instead of using Mujoco, try to use Isaac Sim
* upgrade the task, from route planning to grasping, which requires **nerf segmentation**
* try to speed up the nerf process, like **real-time nerf** or **instant nerf**, to make it useful in daily life

### timeline
June -- pipeline running smoothly

mid August -- report submitting deadline

early September -- master thesis defense

### RGBD VS LIDAR
The functional difference between LiDAR and other forms of ToF is that LiDAR uses pulsed lasers to build a point cloud, which is then used to construct a 3D map or image. ToF applications create "depth maps" based on light detection, usually through a standard RGB camera.

### COLMAP and NERF

COLMAP and NeRF are two different approaches used in computer vision and graphics, with different purposes and methodologies. Here's a brief explanation of each:

* COLMAP (Structure from Motion):
COLMAP is a software package that focuses on structure from motion (SFM) and multi-view stereo (MVS). It is primarily used for 3D reconstruction of scenes or objects from a collection of 2D images. COLMAP utilizes feature extraction, matching, camera pose estimation, and triangulation techniques to generate a 3D model from a set of images. It can be used for applications such as creating 3D models of environments, objects, or even for augmented reality.

* NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields):
NeRF is a deep learning-based technique used for synthesizing novel views of a scene or object. It models the scene as a continuous 3D function called a neural radiance field. NeRF learns to predict the appearance (color and intensity) of a scene from any given viewpoint by training on a dataset of images with corresponding camera poses. NeRF can generate photo-realistic renderings of scenes, even from viewpoints not present in the original dataset. It is commonly used for applications such as virtual reality, computer graphics, and generating synthetic images.

In summary, COLMAP focuses on reconstructing 3D geometry from images, while NeRF focuses on synthesizing novel views of a scene or object using a neural network-based approach.

COLMAP and NERF can be used together in a pipeline for generating photorealistic 3D reconstructions of scenes from a series of 2D images. Here is an example pipeline:

* Capture a series of 2D images of the scene using a camera or cameras.

* Use COLMAP to generate a 3D model of the scene from the set of images, using techniques such as structure-from-motion (SfM) and multi-view stereo (MVS).

* Use the 3D model generated by COLMAP as input to NERF to generate photorealistic images of the scene from novel viewpoints.

* Optionally, refine the 3D model generated by COLMAP using the photorealistic images generated by NERF.

# Nerf Experiments
* Fork https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp
* Create your own folder that containts the video, i.e. jas folder that contains jas.mp4
* cd jas folder
* run the following commands:
```
 C:\Users\jasmi\Documents\GitHub\instant-ngp\scripts\colmap2nerf.py  --run_colmap --aabb_scale 64 --overwrite
 python ..\scripts\colmap2nerf.py --video_in jas.mp4 --video_fps 10 --run_colmap --overwrite
```
* drag processed jas folder into the instant-ngp.exe from "Nerf_experiments\Instant-NGP-for-RTX-3000-and-4000\Instant-NGP-for-RTX-3000-and-4000\instant-ngp.exe"
