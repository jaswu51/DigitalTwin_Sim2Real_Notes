### future plan
* redo the pipeline, may alter the scene and modify the reward function; and instead of using Mujoco, try to use Isaac Sim
* upgrade the task, from route planning to grasping, which requires **nerf segmentation**
* try to speed up the nerf process, like **real-time nerf** or **instant nerf**, to make it useful in daily life

### timeline
Mid August -- report submitting deadline
Early September -- Master thesis defense

### RGBD VS LIDAR
The functional difference between LiDAR and other forms of ToF is that LiDAR uses pulsed lasers to build a point cloud, which is then used to construct a 3D map or image. ToF applications create "depth maps" based on light detection, usually through a standard RGB camera.

### COLMAP and NERF
COLMAP and NERF can be used together in a pipeline for generating photorealistic 3D reconstructions of scenes from a series of 2D images. Here is an example pipeline:

* Capture a series of 2D images of the scene using a camera or cameras.

* Use COLMAP to generate a 3D model of the scene from the set of images, using techniques such as structure-from-motion (SfM) and multi-view stereo (MVS).

* Use the 3D model generated by COLMAP as input to NERF to generate photorealistic images of the scene from novel viewpoints.

* Optionally, refine the 3D model generated by COLMAP using the photorealistic images generated by NERF.
